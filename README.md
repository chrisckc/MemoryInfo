# Memory Info Library for Arduino

## Description

This code was written as my own take on various memory information examples available on arduino.cc
Such as:
http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/AvailableMemory


## Why

To debug memory intensive arduino code required information on what was happening with the memory at various points in the code.
